# GyG repository
## What you'll find in this repository? 
This repository was made with the purpose of work in differents projects at the same time. So, if you think that there's something wrong in the code/documentation maybe IS wrong! 

Here you can find differents projects made by Santiago Garaventta and Kevin Giribuela, both passionate with electronics and (as an Argentinian would said) very "Culo inquieto".

Please, feel free to give us a feedback if you think that is necessary, we'll be VERY happy to open a pull request...
